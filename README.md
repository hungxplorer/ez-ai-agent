# EZ AI Agent

> ü§ñ A pioneering open-source project where 100% of the codebase is autonomously generated by AI.

## Overview

EZ AI Agent is an innovative open-source platform that revolutionizes the way developers create backend APIs. By simply providing a system prompt, API path, and request/response data structure, you can instantly generate fully functional APIs ready for use.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

### 1. Obtain LLM API Keys

Before starting, you'll need to get API keys from one of the following Language Model providers:

- **Google Gemini**: [Get API key from Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- **OpenAI (ChatGPT)**: [Get API key from OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **DeepSeek**: [Get API key from DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/)

### 2. Installation & Setup

There are two ways to run the project:

#### Method 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started, as it automatically sets up all required services.

For Backend:

```bash
cd server
docker-compose up
```

The system will automatically:

- Start the PostgreSQL database
- Run all necessary database migrations
- Apply seed data
- Start the backend server

For Frontend:

```bash
cd client
docker-compose up
```

#### Method 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer to run services individually:

1. Frontend Setup:

```bash
cd client
yarn install
yarn dev
```

2. Database Setup:

   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running
   - Update database configuration in the server settings
   - Create a database named `llm_api_builder`

3. Backend Setup:

```bash
cd server
yarn install
# Run migrations and seed data
yarn migrate
yarn seed
# Start the server
yarn dev
```

### 3. Create API Endpoints

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click on "Add New API Endpoint"
3. Configure your endpoint by providing:
   - System Prompt
   - API Path
   - Request/Response Data Structure

### 4. Testing Your APIs

You can test your created APIs through:

- Built-in Execute feature in the View Detail page
- Postman or any other API testing tool
