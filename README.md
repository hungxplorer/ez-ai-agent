# EZ AI Agent

> ü§ñ An open-source project where 100% of the codebase is autonomously generated by AI.

## Overview

EZ AI Agent is an innovative open-source platform that enables developers to quickly create LLM AI wrappers. By simply providing a system prompt, API path, and request/response data structure, you can instantly generate fully functional AI-powered APIs ready for use. This tool streamlines the process of integrating large language models into your applications, making AI implementation accessible and efficient.

The core functionality of EZ AI Agent is to create new custom APIs that wrap around existing LLM provider APIs (like OpenAI, Google Gemini, DeepSeek). These wrapper APIs can be tailored to your specific use cases, allowing you to transform generic LLM capabilities into specialized, purpose-built endpoints that serve your application's exact needs.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

### 1. Obtain LLM API Keys

Before starting, you'll need to get API keys from one of the following Language Model providers:

- **Google Gemini**: [Get API key from Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- **OpenAI (ChatGPT)**: [Get API key from OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **DeepSeek**: [Get API key from DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/)
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: [Get API key from Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/keys)

### 2. Installation & Setup

There are three ways to run the project:

#### Method 1: Using Root Docker Compose (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started, as it automatically sets up all required services with a single command.

```bash
# From the project root directory
docker-compose up
```

This will start:

- The PostgreSQL database
- The backend server (available at http://localhost:3000)
- The frontend application (available at http://localhost:5173)

#### Method 2: Using Individual Docker Compose Files

If you prefer to start services separately:

1. Start the Backend:

```bash
cd server
docker-compose up
```

The system will automatically:

- Start the PostgreSQL database
- Run all necessary database migrations
- Start the backend server

2. Start the Frontend:

```bash
cd client
docker-compose up
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` and will automatically connect to the backend at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Method 3: Manual Setup

If you prefer to run services individually:

1. Frontend Setup:

```bash
cd client
yarn
yarn dev
```

2. Database Setup:

   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running
   - Update database configuration in the server settings
   - Create a database named `ez_ai_agent`

3. Backend Setup:

```bash
cd server
yarn
# Run migrations and seed data
yarn migrate
# Start the server
yarn dev
```

### 3. Create API Endpoints

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click on "Add New API Endpoint"
3. Configure your endpoint by providing:
   - System Prompt
   - API Path
   - Request/Response Data Structure

### 4. Testing Your APIs

You can test your created APIs through:

- Built-in Execute feature in the View Detail page
- Postman or any other API testing tool

## Known Issues

The following is a known issue that we are currently working on:

1. **Response Schema UI Lag**: When entering information in the response schema builder, the UI may respond slowly. This is due to the debounce mechanism in the schema builder component. We recommend typing slowly when configuring response schemas. AI is actively working on optimizing this performance issue.
